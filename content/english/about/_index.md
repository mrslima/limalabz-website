 **_Founder of Lima Labz | Game Developer | Artist | Music Producer_**

Game development isn't my main career—yet. But I'm working on it. By day, I'm an SAP Integrations Consultant; by night, I unleash my creativity through code, pixels, and music.

I've been immersed in the worlds of programming and art since childhood, experimenting with countless game prototypes. My dream? To officially launch a polished, well-crafted game—one that truly reflects my passion and vision.

Lima Labz is my playground, my escape, and my way of turning crazy ideas into reality.
